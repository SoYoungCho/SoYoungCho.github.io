# Korean ASR Library  
  
Let me introduce you to a project I did!   
This is the project I worked on for my undergraduate graduation project.   
I developed automatic speech recognition library for Korean language, it's called KoSpeech, based on PyTorch.  
  
I also include preprocessing methods for the KsponSpeech corpus (Korean 1,000 hour speech corpus) and a baseline model. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
