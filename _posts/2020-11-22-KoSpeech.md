# Korean ASR Library  
  
Let me introduce you to a project I did!   
This is the project I worked on for my undergraduate graduation project.   
I developed speech recognition library for Korean language, called KoSpeech, based on PyTorch.  
  
This project got a over 100 star at GitHub site.  
    
I also include preprocessing methods for the [KsponSpeech corpus](https://aihub.or.kr/aidata/105) and a baseline model. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž  
I wrote down the contents of this [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03092). (This is my first paper !!)    
      
If you are interested in this software, see the links down here !!
