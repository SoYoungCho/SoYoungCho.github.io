# End-to-End Speech Recognition Models  
  
This project contains end-to-end automatic speech recognition models.This repository does not include training or audio or text preprocessing codes. If you want to see the code other than the model, please refer to here.
Many speech recognition open sources contain all the training-related code, making it hard to see only the model structure. So I have created a repository for only the models I've implemented and make them public.
I will continue to add to this the speech recognition models that I implement.  
  
## Implementation List  
- Deep Speech 2  
- Listen, Attend and Spell (modified version)  
- Speech Transformer  
- Voice Activity Detection (1 dimensional Resnet Model)
